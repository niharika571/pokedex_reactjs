ReactJS Assignment

Problem statement:
 
To build Pokedex


A pokedex can be used to see and search different pokemons and visualize their respective statistics.  


Create a Pokedex application in ReactJS using the APIs provided by


API Documentation: https://pokeapi.co/
All the data functionalities/requirements for the application can be fulfilled by the APIs provided in the above documentation
 
For pokemon image use below url:

https://unpkg.com/pokeapi-sprites@2.0.2/sprites/pokemon/other/dream-world/id.svg
Replace the id with the respective pokemon id.
For example :
Pikachu has 25 id so the url will be:
https://unpkg.com/pokeapi-sprites@2.0.2/sprites/pokemon/other/dream-world/25.svg

The application should contain the following components :
A listing of the pokemon showing cards by default of the first 20 pokemons.
Buttons to navigate next and previous 20 pokemons
The Pokemon card must show the Pokemon name, image, type and id
On clicking the pokemon card it should open a modal(pop up) with the statics of that respective pokemon
Requirements :
Mentioned functionalities to be implemented.
Readable codebase
Well defined web components
 
Recommendations:
Candidates can use any component library (bootstrap, semantic, etc)
Judgment Criteria:
Aesthetics of application (looks and usage)
Api integration
 
Bonus tasks:
Implementation of a search bar that can be used to search Pokemon using name/id. API should be integrated for searching all the pokemons & not just from the current page
Implementation of type filter using API
